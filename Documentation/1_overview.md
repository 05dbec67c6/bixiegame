The idea is to create a two player card game. It should depict a 
confrontation concerning cultural achievements in the area of
literature, art and music.

There should be two factions: germany and china.

The amount of cards should be around 50-60 in total.

It should not have any tokens.

It should use a standardized cards size.

The premise of creation is that it is difficult to keep things simple.

The game should somehow depict the striving for an art/music/literature work.

Art is for positional effects
literature is for effects concerning cards
Music is for culture power effects
